Each folder represents one weekly topic, including basic explanations and working code.

* Week 1 – Array Operations

Topics covered:

Traversal

Insertion

Deletion

Description:
This program shows how to print array elements, insert a new element at a specific position, and delete an element from an array.

* Week 3 – Singly Linked List

Topics covered:

Traversal
